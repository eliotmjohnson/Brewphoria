# Brewphoria

Brewphoria is an ecommerce website based around a fictitious local brewing company with the same name. Customers can go and see what drinks they offer, check out the drink recipes, add different drinks to their favorites list, and as a main part of the website, customers can create their custom catering orders that Brewphoria will fulfill for the customers.

## Features

- A fully functional login system is implemented for customers to login and get access to their cart, pending catering orders, drink favorites list, and change account info, utilizing a Postgres database for all information.

- Drinks are also all stored in the Postgres database and are queried with Sequelize to display them for the customer. Customers can also filter different drinks and then see drink details and recipe by using the Cocktail DB API to fetch the information and display it for them. Customers can also search for drinks by name as well.

- As the main part of the website, customers can add different drinks to a catering order cart and then checkout and send that order to the company to be fulfilled at a later date. They can add, remove, and change cart items to customize their order.

- Lastly, if customers just want to enjoy looking at the drinks offered and maybe even try making them themselves instead of doing catering, they can add and remove drinks to their favorites list (also stored in the database) through their account.
